# This file is used with the UNIX `make' command to create and install on-line
# versions of the WFDB Applications Guide, and also to print it.  Before using
# this file for the first time, check that the site-specific variables below
# are appropriate for your system.

# The WFDB Applications Guide documents the application programs provided in
# the app, convert, psd, wave (briefly), and wview subdirectories of wfdb, as
# well as the file formats supported by the WFDB Software Package. It also
# includes a tutorial on evaluation of arrhythmia and ischemia detectors using
# this software and standard databases.

# The most recent version of this guide is always available on PhysioNet
# (follow the links from http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/manuals.shtml).
# Use any web browser to read it.

# If you follow the instructions for a standard installation of the WFDB
# Software Package, the man pages from this directory will be installed so they
# can be read using 'man', 'xman', etc.  The individual pages will be
# accessible to the UNIX `man' command, and to similar commands such as `xman',
# provided that MANDIR (see below) is in your MANPATH (type `man man' for
# further information).

# If you have the necessary formatting software, these man pages and the
# remainder of the WFDB Applications Guide can be produced in a wide variety of
# formats from the sources in in this directory.  Here is a brief list of
# available formats and the commands needed to produce them:

# HTML		'make wag.html'(requires rman, latex2html, and perl)
# man pages	'make wag.man'
# PDF		'make wag.pdf' (requires troff, tbl, pdflatex, ps2pdf, pdftk)
# PostScript	'make wag.ps'  (requires the above tools plus pdftops)
# printed copy	'make wag-book'(requires the above tools plus a printer)

# 'make' definitions for compiling the WFDB Software Package under Linux

# Choose a value for WFDBROOT to determine where the WFDB Software Package will
# be installed.  One of the following is usually a reasonable choice.
# Installing in /usr generally requires root permissions, but will be easiest
# for future software development (no special -I or -L options will be needed
# to compile software with the WFDB library, since the *.h files and the
# library will be installed in the standard directories).
WFDBROOT = /usr/local
# Installing in /usr/local usually requires root permissions.  On a multi-user
# system where it is desirable to keep the OS vendor's software separate from
# other software, this is a good choice.  Another common choice in such cases
# is /opt .
# WFDBROOT = /usr/local
# To install without root permissions, a good choice is to set WFDBROOT to the
# name of your home directory, as in the example below (change as needed).
# WFDBROOT = /home/frodo

# LC and LL are used to determine C compiler and linker options needed to
# enable NETFILES (code that allows applications linked to the WFDB library to
# read input from HTTP and FTP servers, in addition to the standard filesystem
# support available without NETFILES).  The WFDB library can use either
# libcurl (recommended) or libwww to provide NETFILES support.  To use libcurl,
# set LC to `curl-config --cflags` (note the backquotes) and LL to
# `curl-config --libs`.  Otherwise, to use libwww, set LC to
# `libwww-config --cflags` and LL to `libwww-config --libs`.  If neither
# libcurl nor libwww is available, LC and LL should be empty (and NETFILES
# will be disabled).
LC = `curl-config --cflags`
LL = `curl-config --libs`

# BINDIR specifies the directory in which the applications will be installed;
# it should be a directory in the PATH of those who will use the applications.
BINDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/bin

# DBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the contents
# of the `data' directory.
DBDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/database

# INCDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library's #include <...> files.
INCDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/include

# INFODIR is the GNU info directory (optional, needed to `make info').
INFODIR = $(WFDBROOT)/share/info

# LIBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library.
LIBDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/lib

# MANDIR is the root of the man page directory tree.  On most systems, this is
# something like /usr/man or /usr/local/man (type 'man man' to find out).
MANDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/share/man

# PSPDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the PostScript
# prolog (*.pro) files from the 'app' directory.
PSPDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/lib/ps

# CC is the name of your C compiler.
CC = gcc

# CCDEFS is the set of C compiler options needed to set preprocessor variables
# while compiling the WFDB Software Package.  CCDEFS should always include
# VDEFS (the version definitions).  Under Linux, add -fno-stack-protector
# when compiling the original (SWIG-based) WFDB Toolkit for Matlab.
CCDEFS = $(VDEFS)

# MFLAGS is the set of architecture-dependent (-m*) compiler options, which
# is usually empty.  See the gcc manual for information about gcc's -m options.
MFLAGS =

# CFLAGS is the set of C compiler options.  CFLAGS should always include
# CCDEFS.
CFLAGS = $(MFLAGS) -g -O $(CCDEFS) $(LC) -I$(INCDIR)

# RPATHFLAGS is a set of C compiler options that cause the program to
# search for shared libraries in a non-standard location at run-time.
# These options are not needed or useful when using a static library.
RPATHFLAGS = -Wl,--enable-new-dtags,-rpath,$(LIBDIR)

# LDFLAGS is appended to the C compiler command line to specify loading the
# WFDB library.
LDFLAGS = -L$(LIBDIR) -lwfdb $(RPATHFLAGS)

# WFDBLIB is the name of the standard WFDB library.  In order to access it via
# `-lwfdb', WFDBLIB should be `libwfdb.a'.
WFDBLIB = libwfdb.a

# BUILDLIB is the command that creates the static WFDB library once its
# components have been compiled separately;  the list of *.o files that
# make up the library will be appended to BUILDLIB.
BUILDLIB = $(AR) $(ARFLAGS) $(WFDBLIB)

# PRINT is the name of the program used to produce listings (including any
# options for the desired formatting).
PRINT = lpr

# SETPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the installed files accessible
# to those who will use them.  The value given below makes them readable by
# everyone, and writeable by the owner only.  (If you perform the installation
# as `root', `root' is the owner of the installed files.)
SETPERMISSIONS = chmod 644

# SETDPERMISSIONS is similarly used to make directories created during the
# installation accessible.
SETDPERMISSIONS = chmod 755

# SETLPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the WFDB library usable by
# programs linked to it.
SETLPERMISSIONS = chmod 644

# SETXPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the applications accessible.
SETXPERMISSIONS = chmod 755

# STRIP is the command used to compact the compiled binaries by removing their
# symbol tables.
STRIP = strip
# To retain the symbol tables for debugging, comment out the previous line, and
# uncomment the next line.
# STRIP = :

XHOME = /usr/X11R6

# XINCDIR is the directory in which the 'X11' directory containing X11 *.h
# files is found.  This is usually /usr/X11R6/include, although there is often
# a link connecting /usr/include/X11 to this directory.
XINCDIR = $(XHOME)/include

# XLIBDIR is the directory in which the X11 libraries are found.
XLIBDIR = $(XHOME)/lib

# WCFLAGS is the set of C compiler options to use when compiling WAVE.
WCFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) -I$(OWINCDIR) -I$(XINCDIR) -fno-stack-protector

# HELPOBJ can be set to "help.o" if you wish to recompile the XView spot help
# functions in "wave/help.c" (recommended under Linux).
HELPOBJ = help.o
# Otherwise, use the version in libxview by uncommenting the next line:
# HELPOBJ =

# WLDFLAGS is the set of loader options appended to the C compiler command line
# to specify loading the WFDB, XView, and Xlib libraries.
WLDFLAGS = $(LDFLAGS) -L$(OWLIBDIR) -L$(XLIBDIR) -lxview -lolgx -lX11
# Users of Red Hat Linux 5.0 or 5.1 (not later versions), use this instead:
# WLDFLAGS = $(LDFLAGS) -L$(XLIBDIR) $(OWLIBDIR)/libxview.a \
#  $(OWLIBDIR)/libolgx.a -lX11
# This setting avoids incompatibilities with the shared (dynamic) libraries.

# D2PARGS is a list of options for dvips.  Uncomment one of these to set the

# D2PARGS = -t a4
D2PARGS = -t letter

# LN is a command that makes the file named by its first argument accessible
# via the name given in its second argument.  If your system supports symbolic

# MAN1, MAN3, MAN5, and MAN7 are the directories in which local man pages for
# section 1 (commands), section 3 (libraries), section 5 (formats), and

# If you want to put the man pages somewhere else, edit 'maninst.sh' first.

# PSPRINT is the name of the program that prints PostScript files. If your
# printer is not a PostScript printer, see the GhostScript documentation to see
# how to do this (since the figure files are in PostScript form, it is not
# sufficient to use a non-PostScript dvi translator such as dvilj).
PSPRINT = lpr

# TROFF is the name of the program that formats UNIX troff files (needed to
# 'make ag' and for the covers of the guides).  Use 'groff' if you have
# GNU groff (the preferred formatter).
TROFF = groff
# Use 'ptroff' if you have Adobe TranScript software.
# TROFF = ptroff
# Consult your system administrator if you have neither 'groff' nor 'ptroff'.
# Other (untested) possibilities are 'psroff', 'ditroff', 'nroff', and 'troff'.

# TMAN is the TROFF option needed to load the 'man' macro package.  This should

# 'tmac.dif' for comments on a page-numbering bug in some versions of the 'man'
# package.
