# This file contains default 'make' definitions for compiling the WFDB Software
# Package under MS Windows using the free Cygwin/gcc ANSI C compiler, available
# from http://www.cygwin.com/.  To use this successfully, you need to have
# installed Cygwin 1.x or later.
#
# Choose a value for WFDBROOT to determine where the WFDB Software Package will
# be installed.  One of the following is usually a reasonable choice.
# Installing in /usr generally requires root permissions, but will be easiest
# for future software development (no special -I or -L options will be needed
# to compile software with the WFDB library, since the *.h files and the
# library will be installed in the standard directories).
WFDBROOT = /usr
# Installing in /usr/local usually requires root permissions.  On a multi-user
# system where it is desirable to keep the OS vendor's software separate from
# other software, this is a good choice.  Another common choice in such cases
# is /opt .
# WFDBROOT = /usr/local
# To install without root permissions, a good choice is to set WFDBROOT to the
# name of your home directory, as in the example below (change as needed).
# WFDBROOT = /home/frodo

# LC and LL are used to determine C compiler and linker options needed to
# enable NETFILES (code that allows applications linked to the WFDB library to
# read input from HTTP and FTP servers, in addition to the standard filesystem
# support available without NETFILES).  The WFDB library can use either
# libcurl (recommended) or libwww to provide NETFILES support.  To use libcurl,
# set LC to `curl-config --cflags` (note the backquotes) and LL to
# `curl-config --libs`.  Otherwise, to use libwww, set LC to
# `libwww-config --cflags` and LL to `libwww-config --libs`.  If neither
# libcurl nor libwww is available, LC and LL should be empty (and NETFILES
# will be disabled).
LC =
LL =

# BINDIR specifies the directory in which the applications will be installed;
# it should be a directory in the PATH of those who will use the applications.
BINDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/bin

# DBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the contents
# of the `data' directory.
DBDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/database

# INCDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library's #include <...> files.
INCDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/include

# INFODIR is the GNU info directory (optional, needed to `make info').
INFODIR = $(WFDBROOT)/info

# LIBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library.  Under Windows, this is the same as BINDIR (above).
LIBDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/bin

# MANDIR is the root of the man page directory tree.  On most systems, this is
# something like /usr/man or /usr/local/man (type 'man man' to find out).
MANDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/man

# PSPDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the PostScript
# prolog (*.pro) files from the 'app' directory.
PSPDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/lib/ps

# CC is the name of your C compiler.  The WFDB library can be compiled with K&R
# C compilers (`cc' on most if not all UNIX systems) as well as with ANSI C
# compilers such as GNU C (`gcc').
CC = gcc
# On systems where `gcc' is the standard C compiler, `gcc' may also be known as
# `cc'; in such cases, it doesn't matter if CC is cc or gcc.

# CCDEFS is the set of C compiler options needed to set preprocessor variables
# while compiling the WFDB Software Package.  CCDEFS should always include
# VDEFS.  Add the following options to CCDEFS as appropriate (separating them
# by spaces if you use more than one):
#   -DISPRINTF	  if you do not have `stdlib.h' and your `sprintf' returns an
#		   int (see wfdblib.h)
#   -DNETFILES	  if you have libwww and want to be able to access WFDB files
#		   remotely via http or ftp (as well as local files)
#   -DNOSTRTOK	  if your standard C library does not include function `strtok'
#		   (see wfdbio.c)
#   -DNOTIME	  if you do not have `time.h' (see signal.c)
#   -DNOVALUES_H  if you do not have `values.h' (see psd/log10.c)
#   -DOLDC	  if you have neither `stdarg.h' nor `varargs.h' (see wfdbio.c)
# If your C compiler fails to compile `signal.c', add -DBROKEN_CC to CCDEFS
# and try again (see signal.c).
CCDEFS = $(VDEFS) -DNOVALUES_H

# MFLAGS is the set of architecture-dependent (-m*) compiler options, which
# is usually empty.  See the gcc manual for information about gcc's -m options.
MFLAGS =

# CFLAGS is the set of C compiler options.  CFLAGS should always include
# CCDEFS.  Add the following options to CFLAGS as appropriate (separating them
# by spaces if you use more than one):
#   -g		  to save symbols for debugging
#   -O		  if you trust your C compiler's optimizer
# With the exception of `gcc', most C compilers do not allow you to use -g and
# -O simultaneously.

# perhaps other versions of UNIX, however, you will need to define these
# variables by uncommenting the next two lines.

# options for the desired formatting).

# SETPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the installed files accessible
# to those who will use them.  The value given below makes them readable by
# everyone, and writeable by the owner only.  (If you perform the installation
# as `root', `root' is the owner of the installed files.)
SETPERMISSIONS = chmod 644

# SETDPERMISSIONS is similarly used to make directories created during the
# installation accessible.
SETDPERMISSIONS = chmod 755

# SETLPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the WFDB library usable by

# symbol tables.  'exestrip' is a script that appends the '.exe' suffix to the
# files in its argument list before passing their names to 'strip' itself.

# To retain the symbol tables for debugging, comment out the previous line, and
# uncomment the next line.
