# This section contains settings suitable for generating a DLL (shared library)
# under MS Windows using the free gcc ANSI C compiler.
#
# Choose a value for WFDBROOT to determine where the WFDB Software Package will
# be installed.  One of the following is usually a reasonable choice.
# Installing in /usr generally requires root permissions, but will be easiest
# for future software development (no special -I or -L options will be needed
# to compile software with the WFDB library, since the *.h files and the
# library will be installed in the standard directories).
WFDBROOT = /usr
# Installing in /usr/local usually requires root permissions.  On a multi-user
# system where it is desirable to keep the OS vendor's software separate from
# other software, this is a good choice.  Another common choice in such cases
# is /opt .
# WFDBROOT = /usr/local
# To install without root permissions, a good choice is to set WFDBROOT to the
# name of your home directory, as in the example below (change as needed).
# WFDBROOT = /home/frodo

# LC and LL are used to determine C compiler and linker options needed to
# enable NETFILES (code that allows applications linked to the WFDB library to
# read input from HTTP and FTP servers, in addition to the standard filesystem
# support available without NETFILES).  The WFDB library can use either
# libcurl (recommended) or libwww to provide NETFILES support.  To use libcurl,
# set LC to `curl-config --cflags` (note the backquotes) and LL to
# `curl-config --libs`.  Otherwise, to use libwww, set LC to
# `libwww-config --cflags` and LL to `libwww-config --libs`.  If neither
# libcurl nor libwww is available, LC and LL should be empty (and NETFILES
# will be disabled).
LC =
LL =

# BINDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# DLL.
BINDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/bin

# DBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the contents
# of the `data' directory.
DBDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/database

# INCDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library's #include <...> files.
INCDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/include

# LIBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library.  Under Windows, this is the same as BINDIR (above).
LIBDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/bin

# LDFLAGS is appended to the C compiler command line to specify loading the
# WFDB library.
LDFLAGS = -L$(LIBDIR) -lwfdb

# CC is the name of your C compiler ('configure' will modify this).
CC = gcc NOCYGWIN

# CCDEFS is the set of C compiler options needed to set preprocessor variables
# while compiling the WFDB Software Package.  CCDEFS should always include
# VDEFS.
CCDEFS = $(VDEFS) -DMSDOS -DNOVALUES_H -DNOMKSTEMP

# MFLAGS is the set of architecture-dependent (-m*) compiler options, which
# is usually empty.  See the gcc manual for information about gcc's -m options.
MFLAGS =

# CFLAGS is the set of C compiler options used when compiling the shared
# library.  CFLAGS should always include CCDEFS.
CFLAGS =$(MFLAGS) -g -O $(CCDEFS) $(LC) -I$(INCDIR)

# WFDBLIB_BASENAME is the name, without version numbers, of the alternate
# library.  WFDBLIB_SONAME is the shared object name ("soname") of the
# alternate library; normally, this includes the base name and the major
# version number only. WFDBLIB is the complete name, including the minor
# version number.  Symbolic links from WFDBLIB to WFDBLIB_BASENAME and
# WFDBLIB_SONAME will be created as the final step in building the alternate
# library.
WFDBLIB_DLLNAME  = wfdb-$(MAJOR).$(MINOR).dll
WFDBLIB_BASENAME = libwfdb.dll.a
WFDBLIB_SONAME = $(WFDBLIB_BASENAME).$(MAJOR)
WFDBLIB = $(WFDBLIB_SONAME).$(MINOR)
# For a shared library, the soname is significant for proper run-time binding.
# If you change function interfaces in the library, change its soname by



# incrementing the major version number;  when you do this, set the minor
# version number to zero.  If you change the library without changing the
# function interfaces, increment the minor version number; this allows existing
# binaries to use the new version without recompilation, since the soname is
# unchanged in this case.

# BUILDLIB is the command that creates the shared WFDB library once its
# components have been compiled separately;  the list of *.o files that
# make up the library will be appended to BUILDLIB.
BUILDLIB = gcc NOCYGWIN -shared -o $(WFDBLIB_DLLNAME) \
  -Wl,--out-implib=$(WFDBLIB) \
  -Wl,--export-all-symbols \
  -Wl,--enable-auto-import

# BUILDLIB_LDFLAGS is a list of arguments appended to BUILDLIB following
# the list of *.o files.
BUILDLIB_LDFLAGS = $(LL)
 
# LDCONFIG is the name of the program needed to refresh the system's cached
# index of shared libraries.
LDCONFIG = /sbin/ldconfig

# PRINT is the name of the program used to produce listings (including any
# options for the desired formatting).
PRINT = lpr

# SETPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the installed files accessible
# to those who will use them.  The value given below makes them readable by
# everyone, and writeable by the owner only.  (If you perform the installation
# as `root', `root' is the owner of the installed files.)
SETPERMISSIONS = chmod 644

# SETDPERMISSIONS is similarly used to make directories created during the
# installation accessible.
SETDPERMISSIONS = chmod 755

# SETLPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the WFDB library usable by
# programs linked to it.
SETLPERMISSIONS = chmod 755

# `make' (with no target specified) will be equivalent to `make all'.
make-all:	all

# `make lib-post-install' should be run after installing the WFDB library.
lib-post-install:
	cd $(LIBDIR); ln -sf $(WFDBLIB) $(WFDBLIB_BASENAME)
	cd $(LIBDIR); ln -sf $(WFDBLIB) $(WFDBLIB_SONAME)
	mkdir -p $(BINDIR); $(SETDPERMISSIONS) $(BINDIR)
	cp $(WFDBLIB_DLLNAME) $(BINDIR)

lib-post-uninstall:
	rm -f $(LIBDIR)/$(WFDBLIB_BASENAME)
	rm -f $(LIBDIR)/$(WFDBLIB_SONAME)
	rm -f $(BINDIR)/$(WFDBLIB_DLLNAME)
