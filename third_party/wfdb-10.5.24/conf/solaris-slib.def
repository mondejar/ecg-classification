# This section contains settings suitable for generating a shared library under
# Solaris.

# Choose a value for WFDBROOT to determine where the WFDB Software Package will
# be installed.  One of the following is usually a reasonable choice.
# Installing in /usr generally requires root permissions, but will be easiest
# for future software development (no special -I or -L options will be needed
# to compile software with the WFDB library, since the *.h files and the
# library will be installed in the standard directories).
WFDBROOT = /usr
# Installing in /usr/local usually requires root permissions.  On a multi-user
# system where it is desirable to keep the OS vendor's software separate from
# other software, this is a good choice.  Another common choice in such cases
# is /opt .
# WFDBROOT = /usr/local
# To install without root permissions, a good choice is to set WFDBROOT to the
# name of your home directory, as in the example below (change as needed).
# WFDBROOT = /home/frodo

# LC and LL are used to determine C compiler and linker options needed to
# enable NETFILES (code that allows applications linked to the WFDB library to
# read input from HTTP and FTP servers, in addition to the standard filesystem
# support available without NETFILES).  The WFDB library can use either
# libcurl (recommended) or libwww to provide NETFILES support.  To use libcurl,
# set LC to `curl-config --cflags` (note the backquotes) and LL to
# `curl-config --libs`.  Otherwise, to use libwww, set LC to
# `libwww-config --cflags` and LL to `libwww-config --libs`.  If neither
# libcurl nor libwww is available, LC and LL should be empty (and NETFILES
# will be disabled).
LC =
LL =

# BINDIR specifies the directory in which the applications will be installed;
# it should be a directory in the PATH of those who will use the applications.
BINDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/bin

# DBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the contents
# of the `data' directory.
DBDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/database

# INCDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library's #include <...> files.
INCDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/include

# LIBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library.
LIBDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/lib

# RPATHFLAGS is a set of C compiler options that cause the program to
# search for shared libraries in a non-standard location at run-time.
# These options are not needed or useful when using a static library.
RPATHFLAGS = -R$(LIBDIR)

# LDFLAGS is appended to the C compiler command line to specify loading the
# WFDB library.
LDFLAGS = -L$(LIBDIR) -lwfdb $(RPATHFLAGS) $(LL)

# CC is the name of your C compiler.
CC = gcc

# CCDEFS is the set of C compiler options needed to set preprocessor variables
# while compiling the WFDB Software Package.  CCDEFS should always include
# VDEFS.
CCDEFS = $(VDEFS)

# MFLAGS is the set of architecture-dependent (-m*) compiler options, which
# is usually empty.  See the gcc manual for information about gcc's -m options.
MFLAGS =

# CFLAGS is the set of C compiler options used when compiling the shared
# library.  CFLAGS should always include CCDEFS.  These settings are for use
# with gcc:
CFLAGS = $(MFLAGS) -fpic -g -O $(CCDEFS) $(LC) -I$(INCDIR)
# For SunOS cc, uncomment the next line. MFLAGS is gcc-specific, thus excluded.
# CFLAGS = -pic -O $(CCDEFS) $(LC) -I$(INCDIR)
# For Solaris or SVR4 cc, uncomment the next line.
# CFLAGS = -K PIC -O $(CCDEFS) $(LC) -I$(INCDIR)

# WFDBLIB_BASENAME is the name, without version numbers, of the alternate
# library.  WFDBLIB_SONAME is the shared object name ("soname") of the
# alternate library; normally, this includes the base name and the major
# version number only. WFDBLIB is the complete name, including the minor
# version number.  Symbolic links from WFDBLIB to WFDBLIB_BASENAME and
# WFDBLIB_SONAME will be created as the final step in building the alternate
# library.
WFDBLIB_BASENAME = libwfdb.so
WFDBLIB_SONAME = $(WFDBLIB_BASENAME).$(MAJOR)
WFDBLIB = $(WFDBLIB_SONAME).$(MINOR)
# For a shared library, the soname is significant for proper run-time binding.
# If you change function interfaces in the library, change its soname by
# incrementing the major version number;  when you do this, set the minor
# version number to zero.  If you change the library without changing the
# function interfaces, increment the minor version number; this allows existing
# binaries to use the new version without recompilation, since the soname is
# unchanged in this case.

# BUILDLIB is the command that creates the shared WFDB library once its
# components have been compiled separately;  the list of *.o files that
# make up the library will be appended to BUILDLIB.
BUILDLIB = ld -o $(WFDBLIB) -G -z text $(LL)

# BUILDLIB_LDFLAGS is a list of arguments appended to BUILDLIB following
# the list of *.o files (for most platforms, BUILDLIB_LDFLAGS is empty).
BUILDLIB_LDFLAGS =

# PRINT is the name of the program used to produce listings (including any
# options for the desired formatting).
PRINT = lpr

# SETPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the installed files accessible
# to those who will use them.  The value given below makes them readable by
# everyone, and writeable by the owner only.  (If you perform the installation
# as `root', `root' is the owner of the installed files.)
SETPERMISSIONS = chmod 644

# SETDPERMISSIONS is similarly used to make directories created during the
# installation accessible.
SETDPERMISSIONS = chmod 755

# SETLPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the WFDB library usable by
# programs linked to it.
SETLPERMISSIONS = chmod 644

# `make' (with no target specified) will be equivalent to `make all'.
make-all:	all

# `make lib-post-install' should be run after installing the WFDB library.
lib-post-install:
	cd $(LIBDIR); rm $(WFDBLIB_BASENAME) $(WFDBLIB_SONAME); \
	 ln -s $(WFDBLIB) $(WFDBLIB_BASENAME); \
	 ln -s $(WFDBLIB) $(WFDBLIB_SONAME)

lib-post-uninstall:
	rm -f $(LIBDIR)/$(WFDBLIB_BASENAME)
	rm -f $(LIBDIR)/$(WFDBLIB_SONAME)
